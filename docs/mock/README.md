# Quick Start

This is a quick mock-up of the different API calls that can be made with the vault helper tool. This tool interacts with HashiCorp's
[Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), and uses HashiCorp's official
[Go client library](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/vault/api).

## How To Use

Prior to running this, Go and Vault should be installed. You might also need to 
Run the script `./run.sh` to set up a Vault dev server and run the example code.


## Next Steps

We will use these commands in the CLI
